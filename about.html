			<p class="about-content">Hello, we are the Kramers. Ryan, Cassie, and little EmmaLeigh. We are a simple family looking for the american dream of financial freedom. We moved to utah in 2014, and shortly after had our first child. We have been pursuing various avenues of income, but ulitmately dream of being our own bosses, having residual income, and the freedom of time that it brings.</p>
		
			<p class="about-content">We started this business when it was introduced to us by some friends. We spent a couple evenings doing extensive research, and pondering and praying about it, before feeling it was the right path for us. In a remarkable coincidence (or revelation if you believe in it), Cassie's mom had at the same time been looking to re-sign up as a customer with the company. She had used the products in the past, and loved them. This was the final answer we were looking for. We signed up in June of 2016, and are rapidly building our business. </p>
